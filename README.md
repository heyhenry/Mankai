# App Name: Mankai

## App Name Derivation:
Man for Manga, and also the proper pronunciation of it sounds appealing to me. Kai for the japanese word for ocean and blessing (ref: https://www.japannihon.com/what-does-kai-mean-in-japanese/).
With these in consideration, there is homage to the japanese and manga as being the gateway towards the discovery of this new world of content and ocean to signify and highlight analogically that this app goes 
beyond the borders of a nation and reaches as far as the ocean (basically, there is more than manga permitted; i.e. manhwa, manhua).

## Brief Description: 
Currently* this app will allow the user to have a nice, potentially customised desktop application that provides record keeping of their mangas read, reading and will read. Additionally, it will focus on only displaying what is important
and reduce clutter that can be found on official sites like MyAnimeList. A strong selling point will also be the ability for a user to access a larger database as there will be multiple databases available for content lookup and there will be
the ability to add data entries for content that may not have officially been approved on other record keeping sites like MyAnimeList and AniList.

## Features:
- Discovery Page (Default Page)
- Search Page
- MyList Page
- Record Page (CRUD)
- Stats Page
*Note: page names may be subject to renaming conventions (i.e. Mankai's Leaf, Mankai's Discovery, Mankai's Library etc.)

## Technical Hurdles/Concepts:
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Pagination 
- Search Bar
	- Fuzzy searching
	- Filters
- dynamic data appearance (i.e. search vs results display on the same page)

## Journey -> Manga data only first
-> Manhwa
-> Manhua
-> Anime series/movies incl. korean & chinese content
