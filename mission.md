# to do next
- Create wireframe for the register and login pages (in process of register page)

# waaay later 
- implement email field and save data (probably at the registeration level), for potentially recovering account or newsletters or changelog updates?
    - most likely make it optional (user's perogative to have this option)
        - ability to amend/update in the settingspage at a later date if the user decides to change their mind
    * personal note to self: this is actually great i think because saving their passwords with their usernames would give them a method of recovery, but also since the data usage is localised, if anyone wanted to hack them, they would need to be on the specific computer that hosts the app's data?
        - got to still think about this some more, puzzle not fully solved... visually.
